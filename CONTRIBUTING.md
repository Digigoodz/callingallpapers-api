# Welcome!

So you are interested in contributing to the callingallpapers-API? That's great!

But how to start? Have a look at the [issue-list](issues). We try to mark easy
things as "easy-pick". There's something missing in your eyes? Feel free to add
it. Either by sharing your ideas or concerns via a new issue or by adding a
Pull-Request.

For that you'll want to setup the API on your dev-environment. To do so:

1. Fork the project
2. Clone your repository onto your dev-machine.
3. Setup a webserver with one of the following setups.
